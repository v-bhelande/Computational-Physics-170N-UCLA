This repository contains all labs and projects for the course Physics 170N at UCLA taught by Professor Rahul Roy in Spring Quarter 2024. All credit for tutorials, problem sets, and projects goes to Professor Roy, Dr. Dzmitry Vaido, and the Physics and Astronomy department at UCLA. Project 4 is the final project for this course where students work individually on applying a computational method to a problem in physics and astronomy. For more details, refer to the Project4 folder. My topic was "Using Convolutional Neural Netowrks to Predict the States of 2D Ising Models."
